## Overview of UniID
UniID is similar to the blockchain, but has a critical difference: it cannot be influenced by powerful entities. This makes it a tool for indisputable change far beyond what the blockchain can achieve. To do this, UniID had to find a way to eliminate the "buy in" process from the blockchain.

For those unfamiliar with the blockchain, some context is in order. The blockchain creates a democratized system that provides proof of transfer, a digital currency that prevents wealth confiscation, and a number of other functions. For the blockchain to be susceptible to fraud, a single entity would have to control 51% of the system. This makes it tamper-proof in practice, as it is an impractical goal to control over half of the blockchain.

UniID has a far stronger resistance to fraud, and acceptance into the system cannot be purchased. That solution is to build the trust network with genuine identities, rather than with anonymous accounts and payments.

## Building the Trust Network
The trust network is built by verifying and vouching for those who you know in person and are most familiar with; like a social network of identity proof. If someone vouches for a fake user, all of their vouchers will be eliminated and their account could suffer harsh penalties or be removed from the system. New accounts will have to receive and maintain vouchers from trusted members, integrate with the social networks with the people they know, and will then be subject to other forms of verification afterward.

In order to theoretically exploit the system you would need to convince a network of trusted accounts to lie on your behalf, who themselves would then be susceptible to elimination for doing so.

### Rules with Building Trust
* Each account receives 10 vouchers, plus 1 voucher for every voucher it has received.
* Each account must apply 20 vouchers before it can be activated.
* Each account receives X units of currency for each voucher it has sent, up to a maximum of 100 vouchers.
* If an account vouches for a fraudulent account, it gets marked as untrustworthy or fraudulent based on its vouchers received.
* Accounts that are not trusted will have to undergo review and additional verification to restore its functions.
