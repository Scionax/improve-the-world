After years of working on the human equivalent of this language and designing it as a Universal Language, I've decided to adopt an "AI first" approach after spending some time considering a fixed-width variation that would require no delimiters.

A fixed-width variant for this language will provide HUGE advantages that unbind me from the significant limitations of a 256 bit design, provide multiple opportunities for optimization, potentially adds significant clarity to the language, and more.

This variant will use two characters to represent a full concept, and will not require a lookup for the delimiter between values. The removal of that lookup alone is a significant optimization, and multiple formatting options will now available to be optimized further.

This variant should still be highly adaptable as the universal language I've had in mind all these years, but given the speed that AI is progressing, I would rather focus on this.

I will most likely create a new repository for this language variant once I've finished a good draft state.
