# English 2.0 - Significant Language Optimizations

Though it would be better to build a new universal language given how much we can optimize, there are many measures that could be taken to drastically English in the meantimee. This is true for both AI and humans, but particularly for AI since they won't be as disagreeable to change.

These changes would be extremely beneficial for those who struggle to read, but are also meaningful to all users of English; including AI.

### Make Vowels Phonetic
* Significantly reduces memory and cognitive burden for language tasks for humans.
* Simplifying language in this way could significantly help those who struggle with learning to read.
* Clarifies the differences in many words.
* Text-to-Voice software would know exactly how to make all vowel sounds with any lookups or computation required.

The first step is to make all vowels phonetic, which is achieved in two ways simultaneously. Introduce seven new vowels, and assign existing vowel combinations as phonetic equivalents. For example, á would represent the "a" sound in "case" and "train." It can be represented as "á" or "aa" - both are the same sound.

The new vowel list for English:
	
	a - ah, as in stall, fall, hall
	e - eh, as in bet, get, set
	i - ih, as in bin, kin, win
	o - oh, as in go, row, flow
	u - uh, as in gut, bucket, dust
	á - aa, as in brain, vain, sane; also represented with "aa"
	ā - aw, as in paw, claw, straw; also represented with "aw"
	é - ee, as in green, team, dream; also represented with "ee"
	î - ii, as in tie, cry, sly; also represented with "ii"
	ō - oo, as in boo, moo, glue, flu; also represented with "oo"
	ŏ - ow, as in now, cow, pow; also represented with "ow"
	ó - oi, as in toy, enjoy, destroy; also represented with "oi"

Many words would change in a way that becomes phonetic. For example:
	
	stain -> staan or stán
	glue -> gloo or glō

This also helps distinguish certain words from one another, such as "wind" (movement of air) and "wiind" (coiling something).


### Make Consonants Phonetic
* Significantly reduces memory and cognitive burden for language tasks for humans.
* All spelling memorization is now irradicated completely for humans.
* Simplifying language in this way could significantly help those who struggle with learning to read.
* Clarifies the differences in many words.
* Text-to-Voice software would know exactly how to make all words sounds with any lookups or computation required.

Next, all consonants get assigned to specific phonetic sounds. This works roughly like it did with the vowel section. Combinations of consonants also have pre-defined phonetic sounds. This way, the entire language is now a phonetic language.

Many humans, particularly whose natures are to resist change, are likely to complain about how strange the words look now, despite the optimizations it provides. Nevertheless, the language would now be fully phonetic. The advantage of not having to memorize any spelling could be extremely impactful for those who struggle to read.


### Eliminate all Irregular Word Exceptions
* Removes cognitive strain on language tasks; for both humans and AI.
* Removes thousands of memory requirements for the language; for both humans and AI.

English has a large number of irregular words that add cognitive strain. With English 2.0, all irregular grammatical rules for specific words are removed.

For example: the -s, -ed, and -ing endings become consistent across all words. "Geese" would be "gooses" and "ran" would be "runned."
