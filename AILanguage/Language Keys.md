This is just a quick draft based on years of work on language, distilling it down to the fewest components possible.

There are more than this, and I'll add them soon once I'm happy with how they're organized.

I'm hoping to get this online so that when sufficiently advanced AI (hopefully GPT-3) can assist me with it, it will be here for review.
