This is a draft based on years of work on this language, distilling it down to the fewest components that make sense for its intended purpose.

This current set includes exactly 256 components. A small number of these components have naturally-extended sets where applicable.

My hope is that sufficiently advanced AI (hopefully GPT-3 in the near future) can assist me with developing the vocabulary, which should allow me to refine the language.
