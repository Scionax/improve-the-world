### By using conceptual modules as characters, the language:
* Is universally translatable.
* Is exponentially easier to understand.
* Is exponentially easier to learn.
* Is exponentially easier to memorize.
* Can intuitively know nearly every common word using only a single base module set.
* Has a far easier grammatical structure.
* Uses far fewer characters to express the same information.
* Is easily categorized into sensible heirarchies.
* Is more stable and reliable.
* Is far more optimized.


### The first principle of language is not letters. It is concepts.

A true universal language essentially must use *conceptual modules* as its characters, NOT arbitrary symbols associated by sound.

This language seeks to resolve the issues with legacy languages (like English) with a far superior alternative; particularly one that will be far better suited for AI.
