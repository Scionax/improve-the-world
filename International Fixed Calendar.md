## International Fixed Calendar
The International Fixed Calendar already found an excellent solution for Earth Dates. There's no need to reinvent the wheel on the core concepts, since this addresses the essential calendar issues extremely well. I do, however, recommend better naming conventions than English.

### Summary

1. There are 13 months, with exactly 28 days each, making 364 days. The month of "Sol" is added between June and July.

2. Every month begins on a Sunday and ends on a Saturday.

3. Since every month has exactly 28 days, there are exactly four weeks with exactly seven days each. Each day always starts on the same column, meaning you always know what day of the week it is based the date alone.

4. There is a calibration day known as "Year Day" at the end of each year, bringing the total days to 365.

5. Since Earth has a calibration requirement every leap year, there is also a "Leap Day" between June and Sol on every year that is divisible by 4 (with exceptions based on calibration requirements).

6. Leap Days and Year Days are not considered any part of the week, nor do they shift any calendar mechanics outside of their day.
