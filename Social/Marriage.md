## Complications of Marriage in the Future
The future will bring about changes that will complicate the modern mechanics of marriage. If a new form of marriage is not adopted, society as a whole will likely disband the notion of marriages altogether.

Even if one disagrees with the timeline of events, certain technological advances are inevitable. With genetic engineering, people's lives will be greatly extended, potentially indefinitely, and youth will be made permanent. Combined with the automation of our jobs, ability to physical modify our appearance, ability to control our moods and emotions, access to universal income, and AI that can romantically match people better than ever before, people will have endless opportunities to discover karmically-ideal partners in ways that were previously inconceivable.

A new form of marriage should take into consideration this expansion of technology and opportunity for discovery, while preserving the spirit of its original intention - to join people in a union that is mutually beneficial. While it may discomfort some to consider, lifelong exclusive monogamy in its current form is unlikely to fit into society at a large scale. With our current limitations, lifelong exclusive partnerships are far more sensible as a social construct, even if it has its faults. But when that life expectancy is extended indefinitely, youth is permanent, and the barriers to travel and freedom have been lifted, that philosophy may bend or break among a large portion of the population.

But the philosophies of marriage have great merit, and it should retain those aspects.

## Improvements to Marriage
* Redefine marriage as a partnership that both parties seek to prosper and grow from, for as long as the partnership is mutually beneficial to their souls.
* Focus on the philosophy of mutual benefit and partnership, rather than as a contract that binds them to laws or rules.
* Eliminate all laws and legal influence related to marriage.
	* Divorce no longer has legal ramifications and does not require an unhealthy legal process to occur.
	* Divorce is removed as a "dirty" word; it is the intention to dissolve a partership that was identified as unhealthy.
* Remove the aspect of permanent exclusivity.
* Remove any dissolution of marriage that occurs at death, since the benefits of soul partnerships have philosophical implications that would extend into the afterlife.
* Consider marriage to naturally terminate itself or to go on hiatus if it becomes unhealthy for the two partners.
	* No legal requirements occur for this to happen.
	* Any partner can temporarily or permanently dissolve a marriage at will if it becomes unhealthy.
* Additional boundaries or guidelines of a marriage are up to those who forged the marriage together.
	* Any rules or guidelines created by the parternship(s) should be designed with the intention of marriage being used as a tool for prosperity and growth.
	* Any rules or guidelines can be added, removed, or altered when the partners feel it is appropriate or beneficial to do so.
