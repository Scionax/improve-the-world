### Quick Notes
The Universal Language and AI Language are essentially the same thing, or they're at least modular in the same way. They're conceptually similar. They build from modular language concepts (such as the "Hand" and "Equipment" concepts combining to make the word "Glove") rather than from letters that don't correlate to each other in any way. It seeks to eliminate all the inefficiencies of modern languages, but despite several years of working on it, it never feels complete. I should at least upload a basic page on it, though.

Better OS and Universal ID correspond together, and they would also incorporate SML (Simple Markup Language), STON, and ASCII Codes and such. There's a lot of inefficiencies in our modern OS and inherent problems with our features. This would seek to solve very significant issues.
