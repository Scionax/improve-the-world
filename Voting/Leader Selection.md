## Impact of the Leadership Guidelines for Leaders
* Removes the concerns of corruption.
* Those that suffer most will always be heard and well-represented.
* Leaders will most likely emerge from those who have suffered the most.
* Easily identify those who should be leaders.
* Easily hold leaders accountable.
* Easily evaluate the progress that leaders have achieved.
* Allows leaders to make real progress, and to do so quickly.
* Allows society to develop and change quickly and efficiently.

## The Overview of Choosing Policy Leaders
* Choose leaders that have agreed to receive the lowest and/or worst conditions within the community they represent.
* Give the leaders the authority to make any and all necessary changes to solve their situation.
* Ensure the leaders are held accountable, and their circumstances are fully transparent.
* If a community decides (by vote) that their leader acted against their interests, they can confiscate any amount of wealth and assets from the leader.
* Laws cannot be designed that only represent exclusive groups, or any group by a specific genetic or cultural property.
* Laws cannot possess exceptions for any group, company, special interest, or individual.

## Notes about this method:
The overview is intentionally over-simplified. The long explanation will eliminate potential exploitations, including those that might not immediately come to mind, but in practice the overview alone would solve the overwhelming majority of issues with leadership and authority.

With this method, leaders are incentivised to find real solutions as quickly as possible, and to elevate everyone in their represented society. They will seek out guidance on what they should do and what steps need to be taken, and then make policy decisions based on what is effective. If they are ineffective, they are the ones that will suffer most, and that can be reinforced by the members of their community. Society, in return, therefore has a reason to trust the leader they've chosen.

While this process will not ensure that the most intelligent leader is chosen, it will ensure that a noble leader is chosen; someone that truly seeks the improvement of their society and is willing to sacrifice their wellbeing to make it happen. Given what we've encountered through history, this is an easy choice to make.

## How this relates to Better Representation
The "Better Representation" set applies to democratic provinces, while this method applies to choosing leaders with more authority over something. In most cases, an intelligent and benevolent leader would make a superior choice to a democratic institution; however, the democratic institutions make sense for certain stages of provinces. Hybrids of these two systems will also work for many cases.

Eventually, a benevolent AI should be considered as a superior choice for a policy leader. Until that time comes, this system would considerably improve what we have today.
