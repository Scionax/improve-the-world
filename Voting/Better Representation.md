## What Problems does Better Representation solve?
* Completely eliminates the barrier of entry into politics.
* Significantly reduces the benefits of spending money on politics.
* Radically simplifies the political process.
* Eliminates the need for campaigning.
* Eliminates nearly all overhead of time and money on politics.
* Eliminates value of media coverage of politics.


## Key Elements of Better Representation
* Voters can choose (or change) their representative between every voting cycle.
* Representatives are just standard voters that are voting on behalf of others that vouched for them.
* Any voter can be a representative. They must register as a representative, which is a free process designed to be extremely simple.
* Representatives can only represent up to 250 voters.
* For best results, this method is combined with Domain Voting.
* Sufficiently advanced AIs can be Representatives for voters; the exact details of sufficient intelligence can be voted on.
* The voting records of all Representatives are public and accessible, regardless of any other laws involving publicity of voting.


## Future Considerations
Eventually, once AI is sufficiently advanced and society has become comfortable with the idea of AI handling our votes, all Representatives should be AIs.
This would solve (or at least significantly help) the issue of money in politics, since biased interests would be (theoretically) unable to use money to influence their votes.

To the best of our ability all AI Representatives:
* Must be acting in the best interest of the world.
* Must be untarnished by biased influences and special interests.
* Must be identified and measured as honest and truthful.
