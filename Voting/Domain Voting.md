# What Problems does Domain Voting solve?

1. Everyone's vote is 20 to 30 times more valuable in their chosen domain.
	* This gives them a much stronger incentive to vote.
	* This makes them more likely to vote.
	* This increases their likelihood of paying attention and being educated on the matters at hand.
	* This makes them resilient to propaganda, since they're voting on topics they're informed about.
	
2. Nearly everyone would vote in the domains they are most passionate and educated on.
	* Votes would now generally reflect the top ~5% of people most educated on the subject.
	* Voters would have MUCH less to focus on, allowing them to hone their attention on important matters.
	
3. Solutions would be guided by people who understand the issues, not by ignorant voters who are just casting votes "against the other team."

4. Voting systems would be EXTREMELY resistant to propaganda, because all of the votes are done by people educated on the topics they're voting on.

5. Votes would no longer be guided by a mass of voters that have little to no domain knowledge in the issues.


# How does Domain Voting work?

All voters should be given equal opportunity in a democracy to avoid the bias and complications that would ignite if they were not.
However, human voters make terrible decisions in democracies; to the point where giving them an equal voice in all matters has been extremely irresponsible.

The solution to this problem can be done with "Voting Domains."

Rather than giving everyone an equal vote for every single possible topic, voters now get to choose which "Voting Domain" they vote on.

Voting Domains consist of 20 to 30 major categories, including domains such as Education, Finance, Health, etc.

During every voting cycle, each voter chooses one voting domain, and can vote on the topics contained within.
