# Standardized Artifact Templates
With advanced AI generation now available we can create massive quantities of artifacts extremely quickly for what is effectively free. The storytelling communities can therefore greatly benefit by coordinating a standardized template for artifacts and other storytelling materials.

## Advantages of Standardizing Artifact Templates
* Creates a consistent format to train AI models on.
* Creates a consistent format for editors, APIs, databases, and other development tools to use.
* Enables automatic integration into other storytelling materials, such as settings, locations, etc.
* Greatly simplifies collaboration between storytellers.
* Greatly simplifies worldbuilding process and reduces the time investment.
* Provides a shared vocabulary and understanding among the community.
* Enables a universal system for lookup and retrieval.
* Simplifies the process of generating content for AI and humans alike.
* Allows storytellers to quickly and easily manage entire settings.
* Allows quick modification of existing artifacts.

## The Artifact Template
An artifact describes an item that is not mass-produced; often one that is supernatural or magical in nature. There are very few (often only one) of its kind, and its uniqueness often makes its history and function important to the story.

The artifact template is a single markup file with specific heading requirements as part of the specification. Some primary headers also have secondary headers.

The designated headers within the template are as follows:
* ArtifactID: A Global Unique Identifier that identifies the artifact within the globally shared library of artifacts.
* Build Instructions: An original text instruction preparing it for AI generation. AI should only read this text, never overwrite it.
* Appearance: A text description of the artifact's appearance and condition.
	* Original Appearance: A secondary header that describes the artifact's original appearance, if different than the current appearance.
* Function: Describes the artifact's function and mechanics.
	* Combat Mechanics: If the artifact relates to combat this section describes it's behavior and uses in combat.
	* Magical Mechanics: If the artifact possesses magical abilities or powers, this section describes the mechanics of that magic.
* Plot Influence: Describes how the artifact impacts the setting, story, characters, etc.
	* Drama: Describes conflict that may result from the introduction, presence, or use of the artifact.
* Perceived Value: Describes how inhabitants of a setting might perceive the artifact.
* Origin: Describes a "soft" backstory of the artifact's original creation.
	* Creator: Soft details about the creator.
	* Creation Process: Soft details about how it was made.
	* Purpose: Soft details about the artifact's original, intended purpose; i.e. the reason it was made.
* History: A soft history of how the artifact has been used, transformed, exchanged owners, etc.
