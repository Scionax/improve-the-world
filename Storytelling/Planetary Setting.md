## The Planetary Setting Template
A planetary setting describes the structure and important details about the planet's geography, climate, weather, seasonal effects, environment, available minerals and resources, planetary system, and how they all interoperate. Some unique worlds may not include certain aspects in traditional ways, such as a planet without changing weather.

The planet setting template is a single markup file with the following headers and secondary headers:
* Planetary Influence: Describes the general layout of the planetary system as it relates to the planet.
* Climate: Describes the weather and climate of the planet, and how it relates to the seasons, planetary systems, etc.
