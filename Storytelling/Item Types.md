## The Item Type Template
An item type describes a type of item that exists throughout the setting that is notable enough to the plot or setting to deserve a description. Item types may also exist when the setting is particularly unique and the world becomes more colorful by defining the types of items within it.

The item type template is a single markup file with the following headers and secondary headers:
* Appearance: A text description of the item's typical appearance.
* Function: Describes the item's function and mechanics.
	* Combat Mechanics: If the item relates to combat this section describes it's behavior and uses in combat.
	* Magical Mechanics: If the item possesses magical abilities or powers, this section describes the mechanics of that magic.
* Scarcity and Access: This describes how common or rare the item is, where it can be found, what sort of access they have to it, etc.
* Plot Influence: Describes how the item impacts the setting, its inhabitants, etc.
	* Drama: Describes conflict that may result from the introduction, presence, or use of the item.
* Perceived Value: Describes how inhabitants of a setting might perceive the item.
* History: Describes any relevant or important details about the history of the item, its purpose of creation, functions it's served, etc.
