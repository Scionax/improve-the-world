## This Simplification Method Would Accomplish:
* Overwhelmingly reduce the number of laws required.
* Result in laws being far easier to learn and understand.
* Significantly reduce the ability to abuse and exploit the law.
* Significantly reduce the ability to instill inappropriate punishments.
* Enable judgments to be more appropriately based on the context and circumstance.
* Significantly reduce the issue of wealth injustices in law, since it currently amounts to a rules war.
* Reduce the complexities of the legal system.
* Significantly reduce the number of lawyers and legal participants involved.

## Simplifying Laws
Laws must be written with the spirit of their intention and the nature of justice to be applied, without the need for extreme specificity in how it must be handled for each case. The law needs to accept that some things need to be regulated, punished, or labeled as crime even if they are not explicitly defined.

The number of laws and the amount of specificity involved in each law has gotten far too extreme, bloated, and unsustainable. It is an unfortunate reality of the nature of our legal system that if it wasn't explicitly specified it wouldn't be illegal, regulated, or punished. This was a clearly ineffective tactic that failed to provide justice.

Some may try to argue that the intention was to remove bias from the law, but the law has overwhelming bias and is failing to provide justice for its citizens. Instead, the law is favoring the wealthy, often serving to protect the guilty, and generally oppressing those who cannot afford to engage with the legal system.


// Note: Can add examples, general rules, how this is actually implemented in a healthy way. Regulations also.
