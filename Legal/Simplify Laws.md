## This Simplification Method Would Accomplish:
* Overwhelmingly reduce the number of laws required.
* Result in laws being far easier to learn and understand.
* Significantly reduce the ability to abuse and exploit the law.
* Significantly reduce the ability to instill inappropriate punishments.
* Enable judgments to be more appropriately based on the context and circumstance.
* Significantly reduce the issue of wealth injustices in law, since it currently amounts to a rules war.
* Reduce the complexities of the legal system.
* Significantly reduce the number of lawyers and legal participants involved.

## Simplifying Laws
The original intention of specificity in the law was to remove bias from the equation. Sadly, that intention has devolved law into a tool for the wealthy to exploit, and the poor to suffer. The law now has overwhelming bias in favor of those who practice its exploitation and it fails to provide justice for its citizens. It often serves to protect the guilty while generally oppressing those who cannot afford to engage it.

Rectifying this problem ultimately requires further work, but simplifying the laws is one step that is VERY crucially required. The number of laws and the amount of specificity involved in each law has gotten far too extreme, bloated, and unsustainable.

Therefore, as one of many esssential steps toward justice, laws must be written with the spirit of their intention and the nature of justice to be applied, without the need for extreme specificity in how it must be handled for each case. The law needs to accept that some things need to be regulated, punished, or labeled as crime even if they are not explicitly defined.

One of the impacts of this change will be a drastic reduction in legal participants, which in itself will greatly help turn the tide against exploitation. It also empowers jurors to make unbiased and contextual decisions, rather than empowering the legal teams.

// Note: Can add examples, general rules, how this is actually implemented in a healthy way. Regulations also.
